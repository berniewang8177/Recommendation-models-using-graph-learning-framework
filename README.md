# Recommendation-models-using-graph-learning-framework
## final project for cs744
Recommendation problems occur in a number of important applications and recent work in DLRM has proposed developing specialized recommendation models/systems. Recommendation problems can also be captured as a bipartite graph. The goal of this project is to compare how well graph learning models do when compared to specialized models like DLRM and if the DLRM model can be implemented using DGL/Marius!
